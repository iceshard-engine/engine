//! \brief This macro is required for a bug apprearing in the MSVC compiler when generating optimized code with '/O2'.
//!     It affects coroutine functions / methods and seems to mainly occur when using loops in the function body.
//!     A workaround for this problem is to separate the logic of such a coroutine into a separate function and mark it as 'noinline'
//!     Once the bug is fixed this macro should be removed.

//! GitHub Issue: #108
