    //! \brief An allocator used to allocate temporary "scratch" memory.
    //! \details The allocator uses a fixed size ring buffer to services the requests.
    //!     Memory is always always allocated linearly. An allocation pointer is
    //!     advanced through the buffer as memory is allocated and wraps around at
    //!     the end of the buffer. Similarly, a free pointer is advanced as memory
    //!     is freed.
    //!
    //! \remarks It is important that the scratch allocator is only used for short-lived
    //!     memory allocations. A long lived allocator will lock the "free" pointer
    //!     and prevent the "allocate" pointer from proceeding past it, which means
    //!     the ring buffer can't be used.
    //!
    //! \remarks If the ring buffer is exhausted, the scratch allocator will use its backing
    //!     allocator to allocate memory instead.
